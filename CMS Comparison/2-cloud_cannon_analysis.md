# CloudCannon

**CloudCannon** emerges as the premier recommendation for professional teams. It offers the visual fidelity of TinaCMS without the heavy schema enforcement, utilizing "Editable Regions" and MDX "Snippets" to provide a true visual editor that respects existing Docusaurus architectures with minimal retrofitting.

## Pros

- **Visual Fidelity**: Offers a true visual editor that respects existing Docusaurus architectures with minimal retrofitting.
- **Lightweight**: Does not require heavy schema enforcement.
- **Flexible**: Allows for "Editable Regions" and MDX "Snippets" to be added to existing Docusaurus architectures.

## Cons

- **Learning Curve**: Requires learning a new way of thinking about content management.
- **Cost**: Can be expensive for large teams.
- **Complexity**: Can be complex to set up and maintain.

## Why it is a "Better Option"

CloudCannon strikes the perfect balance between developer control and editor experience. Unlike TinaCMS, it does not force a rigid TypeScript schema that requires rewriting existing MDX files. Instead, it uses a "Visual Editing" layer that wraps around the existing Docusaurus structure.

- **Zero "Swizzling"**: Unlike Tina, CloudCannon does not require modifying the Docusaurus React code or installing heavy dependencies. The Docusaurus site remains a standard Docusaurus site. If the client cancels CloudCannon, they are left with a perfectly functioning repo, not a broken React app dependent on a CMS API.   

- **Legacy Tolerance**: CloudCannon handles "messy" legacy content better than Tina. It does not enforce a strict schema on every file, allowing for a gradual migration to structured content.   

## Summary Recommendation for CloudCannon

CloudCannon is a strong solution for this project. It provides the visual editing experience that the client requires without the architectural overhead of a traditional CMS like Strapi or the schema rigidity of TinaCMS. Its ability to integrate with existing Docusaurus architectures makes it the most practical and cost-effective solution for this project.
