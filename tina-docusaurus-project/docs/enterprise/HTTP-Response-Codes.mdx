title: HTTP Response Codes
---

Bankuity APIs use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of each API request. Allowing client applications to programmatically detect and handle success, client errors, or server-side issues.

* Codes in the [2xx range](#2xx-succes) usually indicate success.
* Codes in the [4xx range](#4xx-client-errors) indicate an error that occurred based on the information provided (e.g., a missing parameter, etc.).
* Codes in the [5xx range](#5xx-server-errors) indicate an internal error.

The sections below describes more details about each of the codes.
